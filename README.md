# cs6120-advanced-compilers

A bunch of mini compiler projects done for the course Cornell CS 6120: Advanced Compilers.

The structure of this repo is a little messy since I switch between using OCaml and Python for the implementations. ocaml/ contains my work in OCaml while python/ contains my work with Python, sorry!

## Task 2
I implemented basic block and conflow graph construction in OCaml.

I also implement basic code transformations.

## Task 3
I implemented some trivial dead code elimnation as well as local value numbering in Python.
